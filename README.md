# LHL-Midterm-Project

## Project Goals

There are too many car accidents and far too many lives lost from them.  We believe that advertising the same message to an entire population is not the most effective method for capturing their attention and conveying the critical information that they need know.  We feel that developing an age-specific approach in advertising is a more impactful strategy.  In order to achieve this, we will conduct a thorough analysis of the collision data to find specific insights and information, which will further the ability to engage and captivate our target demographics.

## Process

1. Take and exorbitant amount of time searching the world for an interesting dataset.

2. A thorough cleaning process and comprehensive exploratory data analysis to become familiar with the data and how it can be leveraged to acheive our goals.

3. Structuring of the data into meaningful arrangements and creating interesting and informative visualizations in order to better convey the importance of the message and give insights on how to reduce the number of collisions by appropriately engaging the specific age groups.
